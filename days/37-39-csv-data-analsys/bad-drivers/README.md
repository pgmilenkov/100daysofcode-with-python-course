## 1. States with highest number of died drivers.
* North Dakota' with '23.9'
* 'South Carolina' with '23.9'
* 'West Virginia' with '23.8'
* 'Arkansas' with '22.4'
* 'Kentucky' with '21.4'

## 2. Is there a connection between incidents and speed.
There is no intersection between top 5 states by collisions and by speeding.
Hence, without pandas in use, I would say there is no connection.

But there is a small intersection between collisions and drinking - North Dakota and South Carolina are the examples.

## 3. Are insurance companies paying more or less to racers.
Only 3 of the top 10 states where incusrance companies are loosing money are from the top 10 states which are sorted by speeding.
Hence -> I would say there is no connection between speeding and insurance losses.
